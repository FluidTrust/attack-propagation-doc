Modelling Access Control Properties
===================================

Access control properties are modelled with the context metamodel. It is separated in three parts, the usage specification, the policies and the atttributes. The policies are based on the `XACML <https://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html>`_ standard. An initial description of the model can be found in our publication :cite:p:`architecturalAttack`.
