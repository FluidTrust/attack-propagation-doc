Palladio
========

Our software architecture is modelled with the *Palladio Component Model (PCM)* :cite:p:`reussner2016a`. PCM supports the component-based development process. It provides different views on the software architecture such as deployment or components. In :doc:`test:foundations/palladio` an overview of the different involved roles are given. 


Screencast Palladio

In the screencast below a short introduction to the PCM is given. It provides information about the architecture modelling and the analysis of different quality properties. 

.. warning::
    The screencast covers the additional topic of performance simulation. However, this part is not relevant for the confidentiality analysis.
